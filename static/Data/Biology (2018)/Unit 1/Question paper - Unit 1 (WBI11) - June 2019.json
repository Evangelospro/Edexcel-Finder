phenylalanine to azphe in this part of a modified silk molecule.(2)answer \t\t(ii)\t the r group of phenylalanine is smaller than the r group of azphe.\t\t\tsuggest how inserting an amino acid with a larger r group could affect the properties of silk fibres.(4)(total for question 8 = 13 marks)total for paper = 80
