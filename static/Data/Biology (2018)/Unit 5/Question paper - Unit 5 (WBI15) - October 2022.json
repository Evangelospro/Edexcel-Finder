 2p71871ascientific article for use with question 8how do we perceive the world? 1\tone of the great mysteries facing humanity is the question of how we sense our environment. the mechanisms underlying our senses have triggered our curiosity for thousands of years, for example, how light is detected by the eyes, how sound waves affect our inner ears, and how different chemical compounds interact with receptors in our nose and mouth generating smell and taste. we also have other ways to perceive the world around us. imagine walking barefoot across a lawn on a hot summer’s day. you can feel the heat of the sun, the caress of the wind, and the individual blades of grass underneath your feet. these impressions of temperature, touch and movement are essential for our adaptation to the constantly changing surrounding. 2\tin the 17th century, the philosopher rené descartes envisioned threads connecting different parts of the skin with the brain. in this way, a foot touching an open flame would send a mechanical signal to the brain (figure 1). discoveries later revealed the existence of specialized sensory neurons that register changes in our environment. joseph erlanger and herbert gasser received the nobel prize in physiology or medicine in 1944 for their discovery of different types of sensory nerve fibers that react to distinct stimuli, for example, in the responses to painful and non-painful touch. since then, it has been demonstrated that nerve cells are highly specialized for detecting and transducing differing types of stimuli, allowing a nuanced perception of our surroundings; for example, our capacity to feel differences in the texture of surfaces through our fingertips, or our ability to discern both pleasing warmth, and painful heat. 3\tprior to the discoveries of david julius and ardem patapoutian, our understanding of how the nervous system senses and interprets our environment still contained a fundamental unsolved question: how are temperature and mechanical stimuli converted into electrical impulses in the nervous system?","QP_Link":"https://qualifications.pearson.com/content/dam/pdf/International%20Advanced%20Level/Biology/2018/Exam-materials/wbi15-01-que-20221025.pdf","MS_Link":"https://qualifications.pearson.com/content/dam/pdf/International%20Advanced%20Level/Biology/2018/Exam-materials/wbi15-01-rms-20230112.pdf"},{"Page":34,"Content":"

1990’s, david julius at the university of california, san francisco, usa, saw the possibility for major advances by analyzing how the chemical compound capsaicin causes the burning sensation we feel when we come into contact with chili peppers. capsaicin was already known to activate nerve cells causing pain sensations, but how this chemical actually exerted this function was an unsolved riddle. julius and his coworkers created a library of millions of dna fragments corresponding to genes that are expressed in the sensory neurons which can react to pain, heat, and touch. julius and colleagues hypothesized that the library would include a dna fragment encoding the protein capable of reacting to capsaicin. they expressed individual genes from this collection in cultured cells that normally do not react to capsaicin. after a laborious search, a single gene was identified that was able to make cells capsaicin sensitive (figure 2). the gene for capsaicin sensing had been found! further experiments revealed that the identified gene encoded a novel ion channel protein and this newly discovered capsaicin receptor was later named trpv1. when julius investigated the protein’s ability to respond to heat, he realized that he had discovered a heat-sensing receptor that is activated at temperatures perceived as painful (figure 2).
