(a) formulate this information as a linear programming problem.  state the objective and list the constraints as simplified inequalities with integer coefficients.(6) the school decides that the number of training days for middle leaders and the number of training days for senior leaders should be in the ratio 5 : 3 this reduces two of the constraints to 5x - 16y and 4y - 5x. (b) (i) express the constraint representing the requirement for a total of at least 20 training days as a simplified inequality with integer coefficients in terms of x and y only.  (ii) express the objective in the form ax + by where a and b are integers.(3) (c) represent the constraints in x and y only on diagram 1 in the answer book.  hence determine, and label, the feasible
