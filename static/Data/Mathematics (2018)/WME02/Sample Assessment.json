(a) find the work done by the engine of the car as the car travels from a to b.(4) when the car is at b and travelling at a speed of 14ms–1 the rate of working of the engine of the car is suddenly increased to p kw, resulting in an initial acceleration of the car of 0.7 m s–2.  the resistance to motion from non-gravitational forces still has a constant magnitude of 800 n.
