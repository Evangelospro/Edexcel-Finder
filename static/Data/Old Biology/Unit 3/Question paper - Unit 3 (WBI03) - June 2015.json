read the following extract from a student’s unfinished visit or issue report on the topic of the giant panda.\t1.\t the giant panda (ailuropoda melanoleucai) is now in decline and there are only about 1600 giant pandas alive in their natural habitat.  however, there are 239 pandas that live in captivity, 27 of them outside china.  of these, 18 are on lease from china, the rest have been bred abroad.  there are several reasons why pandas are now classed as endangered; humans have some part to play in this but most of it is to do with natural factors such as poor habitat size and low reproductive rates.\t2.\t giant pandas struggle to find mates in their natural habitat as they live in a fragmented environment where they are confined to a certain area, this results in limited movement leaving the pandas isolated.  it is vital for them to find mates from a wide gene pool to maintain genetic variation throughout the wild population.  because they are often confined to a small area, pandas mate with others from their own family tree, which is very bad as they have a poor genetic make-up.  if this were the case for all pandas, it would take only one disease to wipe out the entire wild population due to a poor genetic make-up.\t3.\t giant pandas have very low reproductive rates and a very short breeding season.  another problem the panda faces with breeding is that they take six years – longer than most other animals – to grow into mature adults that can reproduce.  pandas are also very fussy about choosing their mates.\t4.\t another obstacle for pandas to overcome is bamboo, their main source of food.  shortages across their habitat are common.  bamboo is the most important plant in a giant panda’s life.  in cold and rainy bamboo forests high in the mountains of western china, they spend at least 12 hours a day eating.  bamboo is low in nutrients and pandas eat as much as 84 pounds (38 kilograms) of it each day.  however, shortages can occur which can have devastating effects on the panda population as they could potentially wipe out the whole of their main food source in that area; this would result in most pandas in that area dying from starvation/malnutrition.  \t5.\t when bamboo plants reach maturity, they flower and produce seeds, and then the mature plant dies.  the seeds grow slowly into plants large enough for pandas to eat.  giant pandas can eat 25 different types of bamboo, but they usually eat only the 4 or 5 kinds that grow in their home range.  an unusual thing about bamboo is that all of the plants of one species growing in an area will bloom and die at the same time.  if the bamboo plants die out, pandas move to another area full of bamboo.  unfortunately, pandas now struggle to do this as humans have taken up much of their habitat and divided it in to several small areas across china.\t6.\t the giant panda is in decline due to the destruction and separation of its habitat.  destruction of the panda’s natural habitat is now the major threat to its survival.  in the 11 years from 1973 to 1984, suitable panda habitat shrunk by 50 per cent in the six areas where pandas live.  human activity – logging, animal grazing, and agriculture – is the major source of habitat destruction.\t7.\t there are methods to help boost populations, the main one being artificial insemination.  male panda sperm is inserted into the female panda artificially.","QP_Link":"https://qualifications.pearson.com/content/dam/pdf/International%20Advanced%20Level/Biology/2013/Exam%20materials/WBI03_01_que_20150506.pdf","MS_Link":"https://qualifications.pearson.com/content/dam/pdf/International%20Advanced%20Level/Biology/2013/Exam%20materials/WBI03_01_msc_20150812.pdf"},{"Page":8,"Content":"9*p44874a0916*turn over    \t8.\t semen is collected from the male by the use of electro ejaculation.  the probe is inserted via the rectum and placed over the glands of the male’s reproductive tract.  a brief electrical stimulus is applied several times to induce ejaculation.  in the giant panda a rectal probe has been used in successful semen collections.  the average collection time is around nine minutes.  to reduce stress on the animal during the procedure, and also to increase the safety of the procedure, the male is always anaesthetised during the process.  next the panda’s semen is inserted into the female panda so that her egg is fertilised.\t9.\t the target number of pandas to be bred in captivity was 300 and, as of 2010, this has been achieved.  the slow process of releasing pandas back in to the wild can begin.  the release process has to be done slowly so as not to overpopulate the pandas’ habitat.\t10.\tthere are some problems with this breeding solution.  the semen used to fertilise female pandas may come from only a few males.  this creates very low genetic variation, which can lead to the pandas inbreeding in their natural habitat.  this puts future generations at risk from mass wipe out due to various diseases as they all carry some of the same genetic make-up, thus having the same susceptibility to disease/viruses.\t11.\tdue to the use of artificial insemination, pandas may have never bred naturally with another panda.  so, when released in to the wild they may have no real idea how to reproduce naturally.  this would be a problem as pandas would be in the same situation as they are in at the moment; not able to breed and boost their own population to a sustainable level without human intervention.\t12.\tthe use of artificial insemination to breed more pandas can be seen as an advantage to china’s economy.  china leases each panda for 10 years at a price of $1 million per year.  the government will keep funding the programme as long as money is coming in.  this is also good publicity for china and its tourism; if people can’t see a giant panda in their home country then they may go to china to see one.\t13.\talthough the main solution to saving the giant panda at the moment is artificial insemination there are alternatives.  one alternative is the use of cloning, which is where an organism is produced without sexual reproduction occurring.  taking an animal cell and inserting its dna into an egg cell from a female make a cloned animal.  however, there is a problem with cloning mammals at the moment, they often die soon after birth or suffer from various diseases in later life and die young.","QP_Link":"https://qualifications.pearson.com/content/dam/pdf/International%20Advanced%20Level/Biology/2013/Exam%20materials/WBI03_01_que_20150506.pdf","MS_Link":"https://qualifications.pearson.com/content/dam/pdf/International%20Advanced%20Level/Biology/2013/Exam%20materials/WBI03_01_msc_20150812.pdf"},{"Page":9,"Content":"10*p44874a01016*\t(a)\t
