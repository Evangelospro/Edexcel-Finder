with a loss of species at the rate of 0.01%–0.1% per year.  as well as an 80% decline in biological diversity, which is caused by habitat destruction.\t2.\t human pressure on the environment is increasing, as is the demand for access to land for agriculture.  loss of habitats has led to conflicts between human needs and the needs of animals and plants.\t3.\t over the last 60 years, the number of asian elephants in the wild has halved, partly due to human expansion into the elephants’ habitats.  the elephants leave their remaining natural habitat and enter agricultural land damaging crops.  furthermore, not only do elephants raid crops, they can often go on rampages.  angry farmers have begun to kill the elephants as a quick fix solution, however this has no effect on reducing the conflict between humans and elephants.\t4.\t this report will explore this phenomenon and ways to reduce these conflicts.\t\tpotential solutions are:\t\t● \t traditional methods – making noise, crop guarding, making fires, airborne missiles and decoy foods.\t\t●\t disturbance methods – intense bright flashes of light and flares, firing weapons and using tripwire alarms.\t\t●\t physical barriers – trenches, moats, stone walls, standard fences and electrified fences.\t\tall these methods have limited success.\t5.\t scientists have found that the sound of buzzing bees causes elephants to move away.  the elephants make low frequency cautionary rumbles to warn neighbouring elephants.  elephant skin can grow up to more than 3 cm thick, so it is impenetrable to bee stings.  but skin behind the ears, eyes and the inner trunk is thinner and vulnerable to bee stings.  so if elephants are stung here, this may make them fear bees in future.\t6.\t in 2009, lucy e. king and a team of researchers from save the elephants investigated the concept of deterring elephants with bees further and put it to the test.  they used recordings of angry bees, from disguised loudspeakers in trees, on herds of elephants beneath the trees.  the elephants soon became uneasy and vigilant.  within 10 seconds, almost half of the herd had fled with their tails in the air, occasionally throwing backwards glances at the loudspeakers.  by 80 seconds, all but one was gone.  the researchers played bee sounds to  17 families of elephants in this study and the control to 15.  the control was  the noise of a forest waterfall.","QP_Link":"https://qualifications.pearson.com/content/dam/pdf/International%20Advanced%20Level/Biology/2013/Exam%20materials/WBI03_01_que_20140107.pdf","MS_Link":"https://qualifications.pearson.com/content/dam/pdf/International%20Advanced%20Level/Biology/2013/Exam%20materials/WBI03_01_msc_20140306.pdf"},{"Page":8,"Content":"9*p42914ra0916*turn over    \t7.\t in another trial, one farm was protected with a bee fence (shown in the photograph below) and another was not.  the number of incidents of crop damage by elephants, and the number of animals involved, were monitored over 6 weeks.\t8.\t the results are shown in the table below:observationfarm with bee fencefarm without bee fencenumber of incidents of crop damage  713number of elephants involved in crop damage3895\t\tthe conclusion that can be drawn from this is that ….(note, i need to write a conclusion here).\t9.\t the bee fence is robust enough to survive elephant raids and cheap enough for farmers to construct themselves.\t10.\t why not just use loudspeakers as king did?  there is a chance that an elephant may encounter a fence but perceive that there are no bees.  the elephant becomes aware that it is just speakers, so the chances of trespassing increase.  also, the loudspeaker system would be expensive and require electricity to run it.\t11.\t there are some problems.  the african honeybee is known to be very violent and to attack in large swarms.  this could lead to an increase in the amount of deaths of young elephants, or at least cause them severe suffering.  the introduction of beehives may also pose a threat to the residents around the local farm.  african honeybees are well known for their defensive behaviour.  bee stings inject venom into the skin of the victim, and 3% of people that are stung have an allergic reaction, meanwhile 0.8% of bee sting victims may experience a life-threatening reaction called anaphylactic shock.","QP_Link":"https://qualifications.pearson.com/content/dam/pdf/International%20Advanced%20Level/Biology/2013/Exam%20materials/WBI03_01_que_20140107.pdf","MS_Link":"https://qualifications.pearson.com/content/dam/pdf/International%20Advanced%20Level/Biology/2013/Exam%20materials/WBI03_01_msc_20140306.pdf"},{"Page":9,"Content":"10*p42914ra01016*\t12.\t offsetting this though, bee fences can provide extra income to the farmer from selling the honey.  in addition, it could increase the amount of pollination in crops.  this would be an ideal plan for poor farmers.  you could call this a win-win circumstance.  as there is no use of any guns, traps or poison; just a gentle nudge from nature.\t13.\t there are some other innovative new methods.  farmers in tanzania smear chilli mixed with engine oil on fences.  when elephants approach the fence they ‘snuffle and sneeze’ and leave the scene.  it is also an inexpensive and sustainable process adhering to the fence in all conditions.  however, the advantages of the beehives overshadow this method.\t(a)\t a visit or issue report requires a problem to be identified.  suggest the problem that this extract identifies.(1)\t(b)\t make a sketch to show how the data in the table in paragraph 8 could be compared.
