over    2\t the following is an extract from a student’s report on the topic of artificial blood.making blood\t1.\t blood loss for patients during operations can be significant, resulting in an ever increasing demand for blood.  blood donation through transfusion services is likely to remain the main source to meet this demand.  however, more reliable and less costly sources of blood are being sought.  this is partly because of projected donation supply shortfalls and contamination of natural blood.\t2.\t blood is complex and performs many functions, such as the transport of oxygen, defence against disease, the promotion of clotting and the transport of food, hormones and other substances.\t3.\t whole blood is too complex to synthesise, so research has focused on creating substitutes for two of its important functions; oxygen transport and clotting. \t4.\t the structure of haemoglobin was first determined in 1959 and researchers have been trying to develop products which mimic red blood cells (rbcs) to deliver oxygen to damaged body tissues ever since.  several blood substitute products have been developed over the past fifty years.  some products have reached advanced clinical trials in patients whose lives were threatened.  they are as effective as natural blood for carrying oxygen.  however, we are still not sure if there are any side-effects for patients. \t5.\t three approaches to develop blood products for oxygen transport have been used.  haemoglobin-based oxygen carriers (hbocs) are solutions of modified haemoglobin from human, other animals and genetically engineered sources in plasma-like fluids. \t6.\t haemoglobin-based oxygen carriers (hbocs)\t\thbocs have benefits over natural red blood cells.  they show faster and better oxygen distribution.  the sterile hboc manufacturing process virtually eliminates the risk of viral infection versus red cells in natural blood.  100% screening of donated blood for infections such as aids/hiv, creutzfeld-jacob, smallpox and sars is not practical or even possible.  hbocs can survive over a wide range of storage temperatures, no refrigeration is required and there is a longer shelf life.  there are no intact red blood cells with abo antigens so there is no need for cross-matching of patients’ blood types prior to use.  they are a universal product, meaning that patients who only accept bloodless medical care can be treated.  they can deliver oxygen quickly to damaged tissues because of their lower viscosity than rbcs.\t7.\t hbocs also have some drawbacks.  they may increase the chances of deaths and heart attacks in patients with high blood pressure.  they can cause an immune response with adverse side-effects.  haemoglobin does not last long outside red blood cells (3–4 days) and breaks down within the body, sometimes resulting in renal failure.  rbcs typically live for up to 3 months.  the manufacturing process requires very large quantities of haemoglobin.  this is likely to be a constraint.","QP_Link":"https://qualifications.pearson.com/content/dam/pdf/A%20Level/Biology/2013/Exam%20materials/6BI07_01_que_20130507.pdf","MS_Link":"https://qualifications.pearson.com/content/dam/pdf/A%20Level/Biology/2013/Exam%20materials/6BI07_01_msc_20130815.pdf"},{"Page":9,"Content":"10*p39888a01016*\t8.\t perfluorocarbons (pfcs) \t\tperfluorocarbon (pfc) based oxygen carriers are fully synthetic hydrocarbon-based compounds.  pfcs are chemically inert organic fluids, but have the ability to dissolve 20 times more oxygen than plasma.  the potential of pfcs was widely publicised in the 1960s when a photo appeared of a mouse submerged in a container “breathing” an oxygen-saturated pfc solution.magnification ×0.50\t9.\t some oxygen can dissolve in plasma but usually less than 1% of the total oxygen content in arterial blood.  a major advantage of pfcs, such as perflubron, is that they can increase dissolved oxygen to between two to three fold over the norm, depending on the oxygen partial pressure.  a  pfc called ‘oxygent’ underwent clinical trials in the  usa and europe.  it is universally compatible with all blood types, has a two year approximate shelf-life and can be manufactured on a large-scale, using commercially available raw materials.  however, phase iii trials have shown an increased risk of stroke in treated patients compared to controls.\t10.\tembryonic stem cells (escs)\t\ta third approach taken in some recent work has been to look at the possibility of using embryonic stem cells (escs) to make blood.  work on escs almost completely ceased in 2001 in the usa due to the ban by president george bush.  however, in 2009 president barack obama reversed the ban, saying that sound science and moral values are not inconsistent with each other.\t11.\twork by robert lanza and his colleagues has led to the production of human rbcs from escs.  these have been shown to be just as good at carrying oxygen as natural rbcs.  they can be mass-produced very easily.  the dream is to make rbcs from escs of blood type o negative, which can then be transfused into any patient as they do not cause an immune response. \t12.\twhile these are positive scientific developments, the powerful emotions raised by the use of escs and ivf embryos continue to be debated in public forums.  objections have been raised by religious communities.  scientists are accused of interfering with nature.  some groups are making legal claims of unethical behaviour in the creation or destruction of life.  however, another type of stem cell which can also be coaxed into turning into other cell types does not require an embryo.  these are called ‘induced pluripotent stem cells’ or ipscs.","QP_Link":"https://qualifications.pearson.com/content/dam/pdf/A%20Level/Biology/2013/Exam%20materials/6BI07_01_que_20130507.pdf","MS_Link":"https://qualifications.pearson.com/content/dam/pdf/A%20Level/Biology/2013/Exam%20materials/6BI07_01_msc_20130815.pdf"},{"Page":10,"Content":"11*p39888a01116*turn
