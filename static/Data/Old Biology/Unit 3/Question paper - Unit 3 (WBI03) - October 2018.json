from a student’s unfinished draft issue report on ebola.\t1.\t ebola is a severe and often fatal viral disease.  it is caused by a virus in the order mononegavirales, family filoviridae and genus ebola.  the normal host species of the virus is currently unknown.  however, it is thought that the disease spread through human consumption of the angolan free-tailed bat, mops condylurus.  for this reason, ebola virus (ebov) is said to be a zoonotic disease, meaning it can be transferred between humans and animals.  currently, ebola has no vaccine or cure and, with a high 50 to 90% mortality rate, therapeutic intervention is crucial.  however, a study carried out by dr xiangguo qiu suggests monoclonal antibodies as a potential treatment.\t2.\t the incubation period is 2 to 21 days and includes fever, fatigue, muscle pain, headaches and sore throat.  patients rapidly progress to an advanced disease and 50% develop a hemorrhagic fever, producing symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, a shock-like syndrome, diarrhoea, rash and impaired kidney and liver function.  internal and external bleeding arise in some cases, resulting in multiple organ failure.  there are also low white blood cell and platelet counts and elevated liver enzymes.  usually, 6 to 16 days after symptoms appear, 90% of hosts develop a sudden and severe infection due to low blood pressure and fluid loss, which rapidly progresses to death.  ebola can be spread to others through direct contact with someone who has developed symptoms of the disease.  the virus can be spread through broken skin or mucous membranes between infected fruit bats or primates.  the virus can also be spread by objects that have been contaminated with the virus and blood or bodily fluids, including urine, saliva, sweat, faeces, vomit, breast milk and semen.  men can still transmit the virus through their semen for up to seven weeks after recovery from the illness. \t3.\t the average mortality rate for ebola is about 50%.  the three countries most affected by the virus were guinea, sierra leone and liberia.  a total of 8 110 people died from the disease in these three countries up to january 11th 2015.  the country with the highest mortality rate was guinea with 2 806 people infected of which 1 814 died, a mortality rate of approximately 65%.  liberia had the second highest mortality rate of approximately 43%, as 8 331 people were infected of which 3 538 died.  sierra leone had the lowest mortality rate as 9 446 people were infected and 2 758 died. \t4.\t zmapp, an antibody cocktail, is an experimental biopharmaceutical drug made up of three monoclonal antibodies (mabs).  the drug is intravenously administered to ebov‑infected patients.  ebola is deadly because it disrupts the human immune system.  the antibodies in zmapp are thought to block or neutralise the virus, by binding directly to the antigen of the virus therefore boosting a patient’s ability to fight the virus, which increases their chance of survival.\t5.\t the zmapp was tested on rhesus monkeys in three groups of six animals (a, b and c) and one of three animals (d).  all treatment groups were infected with the virus and received three doses of 50 mg kg−1 of zmapp.  the drug was firstly administered to group a at 3 days post-infection (dpi), at 4 dpi to group b and at 5 dpi to group c, with two additional identical doses for each group, spaced 3 days apart.  days 14, 21 and 28 post-infection were used as designated sample days for all groups, during which rectal temperatures and clinical scores were measured.  the following were also sampled for analysis: blood for serum biochemistry, cell counts and viraemia.  group d had no zmapp administered and acted as a control.  all the animals in groups a, b and c survived the disease and were virus free by 14 dpi in all cases.  all animals in the control group d had died by 8 dpi.  in all cases in groups a, b and c, lymphocyte counts were raised above those in the control group animals.","QP_Link":"https://qualifications.pearson.com/content/dam/pdf/International%20Advanced%20Level/Biology/2013/Exam%20materials/WBI03_01_que_20181024.pdf","MS_Link":"https://qualifications.pearson.com/content/dam/pdf/International%20Advanced%20Level/Biology/2013/Exam%20materials/WBI03_01_rms_20190124.pdf"},{"Page":8,"Content":"9turn

testing, one monkey had a flushed face and severe rash on more than 40% of its body surface.  another monkey had a flushed face as well as a rash on its arms and legs. \t7.\t the un office for the coordination of humanitarian affairs (ocha) announced it needed $988m to fight the disease in liberia, guinea and sierra leone.  in addition, the un secretary-general, ban ki-moon, asked for a $1bn trust fund to be set up to act as a ‘rapid, flexible spending reserve’.\t8.\t ebola is deadly because it disrupts the human immune system.  an ebola survivor still has antibodies specific to the antigen of the virus remaining in their bloodstream from the previous infection.  blood plasma transfusion therefore allows sufferers of the disease to have the same antibodies as the survivor present in the bloodstream.  this results in a strengthened immune system and thus a more efficient elimination of the virus.  however, the treatment is yet to be tested on a wider scale.  currently, there are no data on the effectiveness of this treatment in curing ebov-infected patients.  survivors would need to give consent for blood to be taken and this might be a problem for them and/or the sufferer to be treated with the transfusion.  for example, some religions do not approve of blood transfusions.\t(a)\t the visit or issue report needs to describe a main solution and one or more
