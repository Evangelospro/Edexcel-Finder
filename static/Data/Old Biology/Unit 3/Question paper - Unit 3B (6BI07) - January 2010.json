read the following carefully:\n \nin 1775, william withering published a treatise on the foxglove.  in this he reported \nhis research on the use of an extract of foxglove to treat a condition called dropsy. in \nthis condition, the patient’s blood pressure is raised, leading to tissue fluid collecting \nin the feet, legs and other areas, causing swelling.  the patient may eventually die as \nfluid fills the lungs, drowning the patient.\n \nafter seeing a woman treat herself successfully with a digitalis soup, william withering \ntried the soup on a few people, with some success.  however, after a patient nearly \ndied, withering gave up his research until he moved to birmingham, where he studied \n163 patients with dropsy.  he devised a method to find out the correct dose for his \npatients and finally described very carefully-recorded findings in his treatise.\n \nwithering’s researches are seen as the earliest example of a scientific drug trial.  a \nmodern drug trial is made up of several stages.  in pre-clinical research, the drug is \ntested on animals to investigate its general safety before being trialled on humans.  \nhowever, unlike humans, animals cannot say whether they are experiencing side \neffects such as feeling sick, dizziness or mental problems.\n \nphase 1 is the first stage of a clinical trial.  in this phase, information is gathered about \nwhether a drug is safe to give to humans.  people can volunteer to be part of a drug \ntrial.  the trial team monitors these people carefully.  they observe their behaviour, \nask them how they feel and measure their blood pressure and temperature.  blood \nand urine samples are taken to look for signs that things might be going wrong.  the \nlevel of the drug in the bloodstream or tissues is measured and these data help to \ndetermine the safe dose.\n \nphase ii testing is used to find the experimental conditions that will allow phase iii of \nthe trial to give a good result.  in particular, the trial team tries to establish the best \ndose to give.  one thing that must be established immediately is the desired end \npoint.  for instance, the usual end point sought when screening a new antibacterial \ndrug (such as an antibiotic) is whether a patient is free of infection after treatment.\n \nin phase ii, a control group is used to distinguish between a natural improvement and \nthe effects of the drug.  ideally, neither the trial team nor the patients know whether \nthey are part of the treatment group or the control group – in other words, they are \n“blind” to the type of treatment being given to them.  a placebo may be used.  a \nplacebo is made to look exactly like the drug and the patients are treated with this or \nthe drug, in exactly the same way.\n \nphase iii is the final stage in which larger numbers of patients take part.  the team  \nrunning the trial will have identified at least one group of patients who are expected \nto benefit, how they benefit and the best way to administer treatment.  the\nphase iii trial can provide confirmation that a drug works.  if the results of phase iii \ntesting are not positive, several options remain.  by studying the large amount of data \ncollected, the trial team may identify another smaller group, within the larger group, \nwho seem to have benefited.  another full-scale phase iii trial is carried out on this \ntype of patient.\n \nit is common for phase iii trials to be repeated in order to identify a group of patients \nfor whom the drug is effective.\n","QP_Link":"https://qualifications.pearson.com/content/dam/pdf/A%20Level/Biology/2013/Exam%20materials/6BI07_01_que_20100115.pdf","MS_Link":"https://qualifications.pearson.com/en/campaigns/404.html"},{"Page":10,"Content":"11\n*n35114a01116*\nturn
