from a student’s draft report on the topic of anti‑ageing.\t1.\t immortality has been a dream for humans for thousands of years.  the average life expectancy of all the people in the world is around 66.3 years; 64.3 years for men, 68.4 years for women.\t2.\t stopping ageing will lead to an increase in economic growth, but will not cause overpopulation.  millions of dollars are spent every year trying to extend the lives of people who are close to death.  it would make more sense to look for interventions that will prevent ageing.\t3.\t it is thought that, over a person’s life, cells accumulate random mutations due to such things as uv radiation from the sun.  however, not all cells are affected in the same way.  in order to sustain tissue health and reduce ageing, affected cells will need to be removed, leaving behind those less affected.\t4.\t to study this hypothesis, fruit flies were used.  the team firstly had to find out within the organs which cells were the healthiest.  the team identified a gene and named it ahuizotl or azot after an ancient story of an aztec creature, which selectively targeted fishing boats in order to protect the population of fish in lakes.  the azot gene selectively targets weaker cells, called loser cells, protecting the organs.  this is because it is expressed only in that type of cell.\t5.\t two copies of the gene are found in each cell.  in one experiment, the scientists generated an azot knockout fly.  in these fruit flies, loser cells were not destroyed and formed over 20% of the tissue within 72 hours.\t6.\t in another experiment, the scientists inserted a third copy of the azot gene into the cells.  this helped to destroy the weaker cells and seemed to result in the organs becoming healthier and slowed down ageing.  the median lifespan rose to 55% longer than for normal fruit flies.  the results show that azot is necessary to accelerate loser cell death.\t7.\t richard kalish, a psychologist who investigated the possible social effects of life extension technologies, believes a longer lifespan may change views on marriage.  for example, a married couple in their 60s who are in a loveless marriage might decide to stay together for the remaining years of their lives out of inertia or familiarity.  if that same couple knew they might have to suffer each other’s company for another 60 or 80 years, their choice might be different.\t8.\t furthermore, if life extension also increases a woman’s period of fertility, siblings could be born 40 or 50 years apart.  such a large age difference would radically change the way siblings, or parents and their children, interact.\t9.\t people aged 60 and above have different needs from younger individuals.  they work less and offer less input to the economy.  the necessity for healthcare increases and, in many countries, elders rely hugely on pensions for their income.\t10.\tsome benefits of longer living include that since we have a higher life expectancy, time for study is longer.  this means there is more time to learn and to produce.  this will have benefits for the economy as people will become more experienced as they gain more knowledge throughout their longer lifespan.  society benefits from increased life expectancy too.  when people have more leisure time, depression and stress are reduced, people’s health is improved, and hence people feel more satisfied.","QP_Link":"https://qualifications.pearson.com/content/dam/pdf/International%20Advanced%20Level/Biology/2013/Exam%20materials/WBI03_01_que_20171014.pdf","MS_Link":"https://qualifications.pearson.com/content/dam/pdf/International%20Advanced%20Level/Biology/2013/Exam%20materials/WBI03_01_msc_20180124.pdf"},{"Page":8,"Content":"9turn

of genetically engineering people to have extra azot genes, as was done with fruit flies, raises issues with many religious people and others.\t12.\talso, there are no results to show it would work on humans.  it has been tested on other animals but not humans.  some may feel it could be unethical to test it on humans.\t13.\tsome other suggestions for anti‑ageing strategies have been studied.  the painkiller, ibuprofen, has been found to increase lifespan in yeast and some insects.  in all cases the treatment increased the average lifespan by 15%, equivalent to around 12 years if applied to humans.\t14.\twork in spain showed that the lifespan of a mouse could be extended by a single treatment acting directly on the animal’s genes.  the researchers treated mice with a modified virus.  the viral genes were replaced by those of a telomerase enzyme, which has a key role in ageing.  when the mouse was infected with this modified virus, the telomerase gene was deposited in the mouse cells.  the enzyme, telomerase, made from this gene, repairs the tips of chromosomes known as telomeres.  at the age of one, treated mice lived longer, on average, by 24%, and those treated at the age of two, by 13%.","QP_Link":"https://qualifications.pearson.com/content/dam/pdf/International%20Advanced%20Level/Biology/2013/Exam%20materials/WBI03_01_que_20171014.pdf","MS_Link":"https://qualifications.pearson.com/content/dam/pdf/International%20Advanced%20Level/Biology/2013/Exam%20materials/WBI03_01_msc_20180124.pdf"},{"Page":9,"Content":"10\tdo
