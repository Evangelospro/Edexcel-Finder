known as the hormone responsible for stress.  oxytocin also reduces blood pressure, which is known to rise due to anxiety.  this is very useful for patients with hf-asd because in social situations they feel very anxious and stressed.  the oxytocin would make the patients feel calmer and improve their sociability.  however, a patient with hf-asd would have to use the oxytocin every day in order to make sure that their daily routine isn’t disrupted.\t9.\t applied behaviour analysis (aba) is the most effective treatment for hf-asd.  aba considers how the behaviour of patients is affected by positive or negative aspects of their environment.  this approach has been used to treat many individuals on the autism spectrum (including hf-asd).  aba rewards healthy behaviours of individuals with hf-asd, so that patients will learn to repeat those behaviours.  this is also called operant conditioning.\t10.\tcognitive behavioural therapy (cbt) helps people to regulate their fear and anxiety.  this allows them to control their negative thoughts and improve their behaviour.  individuals diagnosed with hf-asd usually exhibit fear and anxiety.  cbt is matched to the personal needs of individuals.  cbt shows no signs of hazard or danger towards the patients.","QP_Link":"https://qualifications.pearson.com/content/dam/pdf/International%20Advanced%20Level/Biology/2013/Exam%20materials/WBI03_01_que_20180508.pdf","MS_Link":"https://qualifications.pearson.com/content/dam/pdf/International%20Advanced%20Level/Biology/2013/Exam%20materials/WBI03_01_rms_20180815.pdf"},{"Page":9,"Content":"10*p51859a01016*\tdo
