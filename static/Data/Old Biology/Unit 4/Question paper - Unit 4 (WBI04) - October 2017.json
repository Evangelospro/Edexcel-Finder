using dna profiling.\tthe dna used can be either nuclear dna or mitochondrial dna (mtdna).\t(a)\t suggest one function of the proteins coded for by genes in the mtdna.(1)\t(b)\t analysis of dna from the nucleus requires the dna to be amplified using the polymerase chain reaction (pcr).  the dna fragments are then separated by gel electrophoresis.\t\t(i)\t the pcr imitates semi‑conservative replication of dna in a cell.\t\t\tcompare pcr and semi‑conservative replication..(4)","QP_Link":"https://qualifications.pearson.com/content/dam/pdf/International%20Advanced%20Level/Biology/2013/Exam%20materials/WBI04_01_que_20171024.pdf","MS_Link":"https://qualifications.pearson.com/content/dam/pdf/International%20Advanced%20Level/Biology/2013/Exam%20materials/WBI04_01_msc_20180124.pdf"},{"Page":26,"Content":"27*p50783a02728*\tdo
