rat is placed in the maze again, it takes less time to find the food.  this shows that the rat learns the way through the maze.    a student wondered whether animals with larger brains are better at learning.  she investigated five types of small mammal.  these mammals and their typical brain mass are listed below:   x cavy (3.8 g)  x gerbil (1.4 g)  x hamster (0.9 g)  x mouse (0.4 g)  x rat (2.1 g)  the student used three of each type of mammal.  she placed cavy a in the ‘start’ area of the maze and recorded the time taken for it to find the food.  she carried out  10 trials for cavy a.  she then repeated the procedure with cavy b and cavy c. the student then repeated this procedure with the other four types of mammal. using the times taken for the first and tenth trial, she calculated the percentage decrease in time taken.   her results are shown below. cavy a 18% cavy b  12% cavy c  7% hamster a 29% hamster b 37% hamster c 23% gerbil a  27% gerbil b 33% gerbil c 42% mouse a  46%
