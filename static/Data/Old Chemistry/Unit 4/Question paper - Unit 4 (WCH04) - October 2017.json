very long carbon chain; they are made by treating naturally occurring fats and oils with sodium hydroxide.  sodium stearate, c17h35coo−na+, is a  typical soap.  the use of soaps was first recorded 4500 years ago, but detergents were developed in germany around 1916 when there was a shortage of the raw materials required for manufacturing soap.  modern detergents are manufactured from petrochemicals.  the alkylbenzene sulfonate c18h29so3−na+ is a typical modern detergent.\tsoaps and detergents clean because the long hydrocarbon chain is lipophilic  (‘fat-attracting’) and the ionic end of the structure is hydrophilic (‘water-attracting’).  a fat or grease particle, which contains a long chain of carbon atoms, binds to the hydrocarbon chains of soap or detergent forming a tiny sphere, the surface of which is covered with hydrophilic groups making it water soluble.  these spheres are called micelles.lipophilic chainhydrophilic groupgrease particlesoap or

detergents over soaps is that the calcium salts of alkylbenzene sulfonates are much more soluble in water than calcium stearate. when soaps are used in ‘hard’ water, which contains calcium ions, calcium stearate precipitates out as an insoluble ‘scum’.\t\tcomplete the energy cycle below by inserting the names or symbols of the three energy changes, and then use the cycle to explain why calcium stearate is much less soluble than the calcium salt of an alkylbenzene sulfonate.  no calculation is required.(4)cax2(s)ca2+(g)  +  2x−(g)ca2+(aq)  +  2x−(aq)(i) (ii) (iii) (total for question
