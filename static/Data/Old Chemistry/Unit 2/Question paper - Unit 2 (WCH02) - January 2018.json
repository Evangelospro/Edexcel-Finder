be represented by the structure below.\noh\noh\noh\nch2oh\noh\no\nc\nc\nglucose\n \nthe fermentation of glucose is fundamental to brewing and baking.  glucose breaks \ndown to form carbon dioxide and ethanol.\n \ndrinks with a high alcohol content are obtained by distillation from a fermentation mixture.\n \nfor many years, the alcohol content of such drinks was measured as degrees proof.  originally \nthis was defined by the gunpowder test.  a pellet of gunpowder was soaked in the drink. \nif the gunpowder would still ignite, the alcohol drink was at least 100q proof. \nthe reason for introducing this measure was that, from the sixteenth century, the tax on \nalcoholic drinks was related to their alcohol content.\n \nnowadays, most countries have adopted alcohol percentage by volume (abv), which \nis the volume of ethanol, in cm3, present in 100 cm3 of the drink.\n \ntoday, most ethanol for chemical use is produced by an addition reaction of ethene.\n","QP_Link":"https://qualifications.pearson.com/content/dam/pdf/International%20Advanced%20Level/Chemistry/2013/Exam%20materials/WCH02_01_que_20180117.pdf","MS_Link":"https://qualifications.pearson.com/content/dam/pdf/International%20Advanced%20Level/Chemistry/2013/Exam%20materials/WCH02_01_rms_20170301.pdf"},{"Page":17,"Content":"18\n*p51601a01824*\n
