lower, society is increasingly looking at \nthe use of biofuels as alternatives to coal, oil and gas.  biofuels are derived from plants \nand examples include bioethanol, biodiesel and miscanthus, a plant more commonly \nknown as elephant grass.  these fuels have the advantage of being renewable and the \nplants take in carbon dioxide as they grow.\nbioethanol is produced from crops such as sugar cane or corn.  the raw plant material \nis treated to produce a sugary solution which is then fermented to produce ethanol, \nwater and carbon dioxide gas.  the ethanol is removed by distillation.  the resulting \nsolution contains about 96 % ethanol.  the remaining water has to be removed by \nabsorption using a suitable drying agent so that the ethanol can burn efficiently.  the \nbioethanol can then be burnt alone or mixed with petrol in vehicle engines.\nbiodiesel is formed by the hydrolysis of vegetable oils using sodium hydroxide \nsolution, followed by esterification with methanol and a sodium hydroxide catalyst.  \nbiodiesel can then be used on its own in diesel-engined vehicles or mixed with diesel \nderived from crude oil.  plants which are used to produce the vegetable oils include \nrapeseed in the uk, soya bean in the usa and palm oil in asia.\nmiscanthus, or elephant grass, is a quick growing, high-yield plant that grows up to \nfour metres in height.  after harvesting, the grass is left to dry and then burnt in power \nstations designed to run on solid fuels such as coal.  in the united kingdom, farms that \nproduce elephant grass are normally situated within 50 miles of such a power station.\nin an experiment to simulate the production of bioethanol, a student produced a water/\nethanol mixture by fermentation of sucrose solution using yeast.  it was then proposed \nto separate the ethanol from water by carrying out a distillation on the mixture.  the \nmixture would then be dried using a suitable drying agent.\n \n(a) draw a diagram to show
