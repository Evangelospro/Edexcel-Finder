commercial wine to act as an antioxidant and inhibitor of microbial growth.   the so2 that is dissolved in the wine is called ‘free’ so2. however, there is also so2 combined with compounds in the wine; this ‘bound’ so2 can be released by the addition of sodium hydroxide.  the ‘free’ so2 and ‘bound’ so2 give the ‘total’ so2 present in the wine. the amount of sulfur dioxide can be determined by titration with an iodine solution.  the equation isso2 + i2 + 2h2o o 2i− + 4h+ + so42− free so2 determination a 50.00 cm3 sample of white wine was pipetted into a conical flask.  the sample was

naturally releasing mixtures of volatile organic compounds.  freshly-cut grass has a characteristic aroma because of the increased release of these compounds, which are known as green leaf volatiles (glvs).  the most important contributors to this aroma are alcohols and aldehydes containing six carbon atoms. the main compound giving freshly-cut grass its smell is z-hex-3-enal.o the human nose can detect z-hex-3-enal at levels as low as 1.0 ng dm−3 or  1.0 × 10−9 g dm−3.  however, this compound is relatively unstable and rearranges to form the e isomer. some other glvs are methanol, ethanol, z-hex-3-en-1-ol and e-hex-2-enal. it has been suggested that the release of these glvs is part of a defence response by the plant.  in one study of plants attacked by caterpillars, the chemical
