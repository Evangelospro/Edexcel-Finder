of carbon dioxide gas.  since calcium hydroxide is only sparingly soluble in water, technicians often make the solution by adding an excess of the solid calcium hydroxide to the required volume of deionised water, shaking the container and then leaving the mixture to settle.  in this way, a saturated solution is produced but it can be of variable concentration. two students were each given a sample of limewater, from the same batch, in order to determine its concentration.  using 50.0 cm3 portions of the limewater, they carried out titrations using 0.100 mol dm–3 hydrochloric acid.  one
