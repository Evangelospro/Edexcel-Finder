compounds of the three main oxidation states (+2, +3 and +6) are brightly coloured.the element and its compounds have many uses, such as the manufacture of important alloys, pigments for paint and inks, colouring glass and tanning leather.chromium is an essential mineral for physiological functions but, above a certain level, its compounds are toxic.  the target in many states of the usa is for a concentration in drinking water below 0.10 parts per billion.  the maximum permissible level of cr(vi) allowed to be released into waterways is 50 parts per billion.  chromium concentrations in drinking water can be measured by a colorimetric method.\t *(a)\t solutions containing cr2+(aq) and cr3+(aq) are coloured due to electron transitions between d orbitals. \t\texplain why cr2+(aq) and
