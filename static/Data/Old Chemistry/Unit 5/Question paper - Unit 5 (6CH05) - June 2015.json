acids can be written rch(nh2)cooh, though in some amino acids, such as proline, the nitrogen atom is part  of a five-membered ring.  amino acids are water soluble, though the extent of their solubility varies.  all but one of the naturally occurring amino acids show optical activity. the formula of the r group for some naturally occurring amino acids is shown below.  amino acidformula of

amino acids moving different distances through paper or gel when an electric field is applied.  they can also be separated by chromatography.  ninhydrin, shown below, is the chemical which is used to locate the position of the amino acids on chromatograms.ohoooh ninhydrin detects ammonia and primary and secondary amines.  when it reacts with primary amines, a deep blue or purple colour is produced in a complex series of reactions.  with proline, a yellow compound forms. ninhydrin is widely used to detect fingerprints.  sweat secretions from ridges on the finger contain dipeptides and proteins.  these are left on porous surfaces such as paper, and react with ninhydrin.  when ninhydrin reacts with amino acids, carbon dioxide is released from the carboxylic acid group.  archaeologists have used this reaction to release the carbon from proteins in ancient bones, and, by comparing the proportions of carbon and nitrogen in the remains, they have obtained evidence for the diets of these animals.","QP_Link":"https://qualifications.pearson.com/content/dam/pdf/A-Level/Chemistry/2013/Exam-materials/6CH05_01_que_20150615.pdf","MS_Link":"https://qualifications.pearson.com/content/dam/pdf/A-Level/Chemistry/2013/Exam-materials/6CH05_01_msc_20150812.pdf"},{"Page":20,"Content":"21*p45073ra02128*turn
