compounds that contain an element in the +6 oxidation state, when six of the element’s electrons are used in bonding.similarities exist between sulfur(vi) compounds and chromium(vi) compounds.  for example, sulfur forms sulfate(vi) ions, so42–, and disulfate(vi) ions, s2o72–, while chromium forms chromate(vi) ions, cro42–, and dichromate(vi) ions, cr2o72–.  the ions with corresponding formulae have the same shape.other transition metal compounds exist with the metal in oxidation state +6.  potassium manganate(vi), k2mno4, can be prepared in alkaline solution but it readily disproportionates in neutral or acidic solution.  potassium ferrate(vi), k2feo4, is obtained by heating iron filings with potassium nitrate and then pouring the cooled mixture into water.
