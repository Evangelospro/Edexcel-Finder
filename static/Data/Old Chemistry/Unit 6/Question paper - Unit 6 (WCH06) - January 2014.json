pour 12.5 cm3 of ethanoic anhydride (a slight excess) down the condenser.  warm the mixture until the reaction starts and then reflux gently for five minutes.  allow the mixture to cool. step 3 transfer the cooled mixture to a separating funnel, leaving the anti-bumping granules in the flask.  add about 25 cm3 of water and shake the mixture.  allow the two layers to separate and discard the lower aqueous layer.  the addition of water converts any unreacted ethanoic anhydride into ethanoic acid. step 4 add about 10 cm3 of aqueous sodium hydrogencarbonate to the separating funnel and shake carefully.  when the vigorous effervescence has finished, insert the stopper and shake the funnel, frequently releasing the pressure.  repeat the washing with further quantities of aqueous sodium hydrogencarbonate until no more gas is produced.  discard the lower aqueous layer each time. step 5 transfer the ester to a conical flask and shake the flask for five minutes with a suitable drying
