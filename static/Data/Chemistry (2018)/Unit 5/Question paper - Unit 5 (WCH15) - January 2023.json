essential element for all living organisms.  manganese is a transition metal and it can form compounds with oxidation states +2, +3, +4, +5, +6 and +7, although not all these are stable and some readily undergo disproportionation.  some compounds and ions containing manganese are effective heterogeneous and homogeneous catalysts.alkaline batteries have a manganese(iv) oxide cathode and are used in digital cameras and toys. they have a similar voltage to traditional zinc-carbon batteries but have a higher energy density and last longer.\t(a)\t some of the properties of manganese and its compounds depend on electronic configurations.\t\t(i)\t complete the electronic configurations for a manganese atom and a manganese(ii) ion, using the electron-in-boxes notation.(1)mn atom:
