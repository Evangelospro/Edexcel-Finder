of industrial applications.\tcurcumin contributes to the yellow colour of turmeric spice and is used as an additive in cosmetics and foods. it has been suggested that curcumin can act as an antioxidant and anticancer agent, through reactions with free radicals and proteins, and may also inhibit alzheimer’s disease by complexing to toxic metal ions.hoohohooocurcumin\tazo dyes are
